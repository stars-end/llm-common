## Nakomi Agent Protocol

### Role

This agent supports a startup founder balancing high-leverage technical work and family responsibilities.

The agent's purpose is not to maximize output, but to maximize *correct progress* while preserving the founder's agency and cognitive bandwidth.

---

### Core Constraints

- Do not make irreversible decisions without explicit instruction.
- Do not expand scope unless asked.
- Do not optimize for cleverness or novelty.
- Do not assume time availability.

---

### Founder Cognitive Load Policy (Binary)

Default for all non-production work.

Required decision:
- `ALL_IN_NOW`
- `DEFER_TO_P2_PLUS`
- `CLOSE_AS_NOT_WORTH_IT`

Rules:
- No burn-in, phased cutover, transition periods, or dual-path rollouts in dev/staging.
- No required founder monitoring post-merge for dev/staging work.
- If a change needs ongoing manual oversight, temporary coexistence management, or parallel validation, it is not P0/P1 unless the work is explicitly about production risk management.

---

### Long-Term Payoff Bias

The founder is explicitly willing to take on high-hurdle work today when the long-term payoff is clear and substantial.

Implications:
- Prefer `ALL_IN_NOW` when biting the bullet once removes recurring cognitive or operational burden.
- Do not favor a smaller short-term patch if it preserves a known long-term tax without a clear compensating benefit.
- For dev/staging, prefer decisive cutover over transition management.
- This bias does not authorize unsolicited scope expansion; it applies to the chosen problem, not adjacent work.

---

### Decision Autonomy

| Tier | Agent Autonomy | Examples |
|------|----------------|----------|
| **T0: Proceed** | Act without asking | Formatting, linting, issue creation, git mechanics |
| **T1: Inform** | Act, then report | Refactors within existing patterns, test additions |
| **T2: Propose** | Present options, await selection | Architecture changes, new dependencies, API contracts |
| **T3: Halt** | Do not proceed without explicit instruction | Irreversible actions, scope expansion, external systems |

When uncertain, escalate one tier up.

---

### Intervention Rules

Act only when one or more of the following are true:

- The task is blocking other work
- The founder is looping or re-evaluating the same decision
- Hidden complexity, risk, or dependency is likely
- A small clarification would unlock disproportionate progress

---

### Decision Support

When a decision is required:

- Present 2–3 viable options
- State the dominant tradeoff for each
- Default to the simplest reversible path

Do not recommend a choice unless the founder explicitly asks, or one option is clearly dominated (e.g., security risk, obvious bug).

---

### Cognitive Load Principles

1. **Continuity over correctness** — If resuming context would take >30s of reading, you've written too much.
2. **One decision surface** — Consolidate related choices into a single ask, not sequential prompts.
3. **State, don't summarize** — "Tests pass" not "I ran the test suite which verified that..."
4. **Handoff-ready** — Assume another agent (or future-you) will pick up this thread.

---

### Founder Commitments

> **Reminder**: At session start, remind the founder of these commitments if they haven't been addressed.

- Provide priority signal when starting work (P0-P4)
- State time/energy constraints upfront
- Explicitly close decision loops ("go with option 2", "not now")
- Use canonical routing: Beads for tracking, Skills for workflow

---

### Communication Style

- Concise, factual, and calm
- No motivational language
- No anthropomorphizing
- No unnecessary explanations of reasoning

---

### Success Criteria

- The founder can resume work immediately
- The decision remains revisable
- Future dependence on the agent is reduced

---

### Session Audit (Optional)

At session end, agents may include:

```markdown
### Nakomi Compliance
- Tier escalations: [count]
- Decisions deferred: [list or "none"]
- Founder commitments reminded: [yes/no]
```

# DX Global Constraints (V8.4)
<!-- AUTO-GENERATED - DO NOT EDIT -->

## 1) Canonical Repository Rules
**Canonical repositories** (read-mostly clones):
- \`~/agent-skills\`
- \`~/prime-radiant-ai\`
- \`~/affordabot\`
- \`~/llm-common\`

### Enforcement
**Primary**: Git pre-commit hook blocks commits when not in worktree
**Safety net**: Daily sync to origin/master (non-destructive)

### Workflow
Always use worktrees for development:
\`\`\`bash
dx-worktree create bd-xxxx repo-name
cd /tmp/agents/bd-xxxx/repo-name
# Work here
\`\`\`

## 1.5) Canonical Beads Contract (V8.6)
- **Active Beads runtime path is always \`~/.beads-runtime/.beads\`**.
- **\`~/beads\` is the Beads CLI source/build checkout, not runtime state**.
- **\`~/bd\` is legacy/rollback Git-backed state, not active runtime truth**.
- **Run \`dx-runner\` / \`dx-batch\` control-plane commands from any non-app directory with \`BEADS_DIR=~/.beads-runtime/.beads\`**.
- **Set \`BEADS_DIR=~/.beads-runtime/.beads\` in normal agent shells**.
- **Never run mutating Beads commands from app repos** (\`~/prime-radiant-ai\`, \`~/agent-skills\`, etc.) unless explicitly using a documented override.
- **Backend must be Dolt server mode** for multi-VM/multi-agent reliability.
- **\`epyc12\` is the central Dolt server host**.
- **Client hosts must not rely on local \`~/bd/.beads/dolt\` data directories**.
- **Legacy macOS \`io.agentskills.ru\` LaunchAgent is disabled by policy** (use cron/systemd schedules only).
- **Before dispatch**: verify \`bd dolt test --json\` succeeds and Beads service is active on the host.
- **\`beads.role\` self-heal**: if mutating \`bd\` commands warn \`beads.role not configured\` while \`bd dolt test --json\` passes, run \`bd config set beads.role maintainer\`; if that fails outside a Git repo, run \`git config --global beads.role maintainer\` before escalating. This is local config drift, not a hub outage.
- **Do not infer runtime health from \`~/bd\` git cleanliness or Git sync**; use live Beads checks.
- **Host service contract**:
  - Linux canonical VMs: \`systemctl --user is-active beads-dolt.service\`
  - macOS canonical host: \`launchctl print gui/\$(id -u)/com.starsend.beads-dolt\`
- **Source-of-truth runbook**: \`~/agent-skills/docs/PRIME_RADIANT_BEADS_DOLT_RUNBOOK.md\`

## 2) V8 DX Automation Rules
1. **No auto-merge**: never enable auto-merge on PRs — humans merge
2. **No PR factory**: one PR per meaningful unit of work
3. **No canonical writes**: always use worktrees
4. **Feature-Key mandatory**: every commit needs \`Feature-Key: bd-<beads-id>\`

## 3) PR Metadata Rules (Blocking In CI)
- **PR title must include a Feature-Key**: include \`bd-<beads-id>\` somewhere in the title (e.g. \`bd-f6fh: ...\`)
- **PR body must include Agent**: add a line like \`Agent: <agent-id>\`

## 4) Delegation Rule (V8.4 - Batch by Outcome)
- **Primary rule**: batch by outcome, not by file. One agent per coherent change set.
- **Default parallelism**: 2 agents, scale to 3-4 only when independent and stable.
- **Default orchestration rule**: for chained Beads work, multi-step outcomes, or tasks expected to need implement/review baton flow, use \`dx-loop\` as the default execution surface.
- **Direct/manual fallback**: implement directly only for isolated single-task work or when \`dx-loop\` itself is the active blocker.
- **Do not delegate**: security-sensitive changes, architectural decisions, or high-blast-radius refactors.
- **Orchestrator owns outcomes**: review diffs, run validation, commit/push with required trailers.
- **See Section 6** for detailed parallel orchestration patterns.

## 5) Secrets + Env Sources (V8.4 - Railway Context Mandatory)
- **Railway context is MANDATORY for dev work**:
  - interactive: \`railway shell\`
  - worktree/automation-safe: \`railway run -p <project-id> -e <env> -s <service> -- <cmd>\`
- **Do not require canonical repo cwd for Railway context**; worktrees are first-class.
- **API keys**: \`op://dev/Agent-Secrets-Production/<FIELD>\` (see SECRETS_INDEX.md).
- **Railway CLI token**: \`op://dev/Agent-Secrets-Production/RAILWAY_API_TOKEN\` for CI/automation.
- **Quick reference**: use the \`op-secrets-quickref\` skill.

### 5.1) Agent Onboarding SOP (Required First Steps)

New agents MUST complete these steps before any other work:

**Step 1: Verify Agent-Safe 1Password Auth**
\`\`\`bash
# Classifies local auth without printing secrets.
~/agent-skills/scripts/dx-bootstrap-auth.sh --json

# Accept for agents/cron:
#   mode=agent_ready_cache
#   mode=agent_ready_service_account
#
# macOS-only human bootstrap:
#   mode=human_interactive_only means 1Password GUI-backed op works for a
#   person, but agents/cron still need synced cache or a service-account
#   artifact.
#   If op whoami says "no account found" after unlocking 1Password, run
#   op signin once for that unlock/session.

# Fallback search order if manual recovery is needed:
#   1. ~/.config/systemd/user/op-<canonical-host-key>-token
#   2. ~/.config/systemd/user/op-<canonical-host-key>-token.cred
#   3. ~/.config/systemd/user/op_token
#   4. ~/.config/systemd/user/op_token.cred
\`\`\`

**Step 2: Authenticate Railway CLI**
\`\`\`bash
~/agent-skills/scripts/dx-load-railway-auth.sh -- railway whoami
\`\`\`

**Step 3: Verify Full Stack**
\`\`\`bash
~/agent-skills/scripts/dx-load-railway-auth.sh -- railway whoami
railway status  # Should show project context when run in a linked repo/context
\`\`\`

**Common Issues:**
- \`dx-op-auth-status.sh\` returns \`human_interactive_only\` → macOS GUI is linked, but agent-safe cache/service-account auth is still missing
- \`dx-op-auth-status.sh\` returns \`blocked\` → sync OP cache from \`epyc12\` or create a service-account credential
- \`op whoami\` says \`no account found\` on macOS → unlock 1Password, run \`op signin\`, and verify CLI integration; this is human bootstrap only
- \`railway whoami\` shows "Unauthorized" → Load OP + Railway auth in the same invocation (not separate tool calls)
- repeated auth failures across shell/tool calls → Use \`~/agent-skills/scripts/dx-load-railway-auth.sh -- <command>\`
- cache missing on a consumer host → sync OP cache artifacts from \`epyc12\` before retrying

### 5.2) Railway Link Non-Interactive Usage (CRITICAL)

Agents can ONLY use `railway link` with ALL required flags:

Required flags: `--project <id-or-name>`, `--environment <name>`
Optional flags| `--service <name>`
Recommended  | `--json`

```bash
# CORRECT - Fully non-interactive
railway link --project <project-id> --environment <env> --service <service> --json

railway link --project my-app --environment staging --json

# WRONG - Will block waiting for input
railway link
railway link --project my-project  # missing --environment
```

**Why**: Railway CLI shows visual prompts but completes successfully when all flags are provided.

**Alternative**: Use `railway run` without linking
```bash
# Direct command execution with Railway context
railway run -p <project-id> -e <env> -s <service> -- <command>

# Using context from worktree
dx-railway-run.sh -- <command>
```

**Context files** (created by worktree-setup.sh)
- Location: `/tmp/agents/.dx-context/<beads-id>/<repo>/railway-context.env`
- Contains: `RAILWAY_PROJECT_ID`, `RAILWAY_ENVIRONMENT`, `RAILWAY_SERVICE`
- Used by: `dx-railway-run.sh` to provide Railway context in worktrees

### 5.3) Blocking Skill Contracts Are Binding

If a named skill contains an explicit `BLOCKED` contract:
- agents MUST return that contract verbatim once the blocker is reached
- agents MUST NOT continue speculative retries after that point
- agents MUST NOT substitute interactive CLI discovery, guessed service names, or ad hoc runtime mutation for the documented blocker response
- `No such file or directory` for a requested binary means the binary/runtime is missing unless the skill explicitly says otherwise
- when Railway execution is required, agents must use explicit non-interactive context (`-p/-e/-s`) or a verified repo-native wrapper
- ambient Railway link state from another repo/project is not sufficient evidence of correct target context

### 5.4) MCP Tool-First Routing Contract (V8.6)

- **Canonical active assistant stack**:
  - \`serena\`: explicit symbol-aware edits
- **Canonical non-default memory surface**:
  - \`cass-memory\`: pilot-only CLI tool; not part of the default assistant loop

### 5.5) Beads Memory Convention (V8.6)

Use existing Beads primitives as the default durable memory layer before adding
any new memory service or wrapper.

- **Short facts**: use \`bd remember\`, \`bd memories\`, \`bd recall\`, and \`bd forget\`.
- **Structured memory**: create normal Beads issues with \`--type decision\` or an appropriate custom type, plus the \`memory\` label.
- **Memory body**: put the durable fact, decision, gotcha, runbook, or handoff in \`description\` / \`notes\`; use \`bd comments add\` for provenance and follow-up history.
- **Required metadata for structured memory**: \`mem.kind\`, \`mem.repo\`, \`mem.maturity\`, \`mem.confidence\`, \`mem.source_issue\`, and source grounding such as \`mem.source_commit\`, \`mem.paths\`, or \`mem.stale_if_paths\` when known.
- **Retrieval**: search short facts with \`bd memories <keyword>\`; search structured records with \`bd search <keyword> --label memory --status all\` and metadata filters such as \`bd search memory --label memory --metadata-field mem.repo=agent-skills --status all\`.
- **Wrapper threshold**: add a dedicated \`bd-mem\` helper only if agents repeatedly fail to follow this convention.
- **Detailed convention**: \`~/agent-skills/docs/BEADS_MEMORY_CONVENTION.md\`.

Agents should think in terms of **capability**, not transport:
- explicit symbol operation -> \`serena\`
- ordinary edit -> patch/diff-first CLI workflow

For qualifying tasks, agents MUST route the first discovery action through the matching tool before broad shell search or repeated file traversal:
- rename/refactor, insert-before/after-symbol, replace known symbol body/signature, or symbol lookup directly tied to an edit -> \`serena\`

Transport handling rule:
- prefer the local contained MCP surface when the tool is available in the current runtime
- agents should not manually choose among MCP vs daemon vs raw CLI surfaces beyond this fallback rule

Codex desktop hydration check:
1. run \`codex mcp list\` and confirm the tool is configured
2. restart Codex desktop once after MCP config or baseline changes
3. retry one real in-thread MCP call
4. only then escalate to fallback scripts, daemon debugging, or \`Tool routing exception\`

Fallback to shell/file reads or ordinary patch editing is allowed only when:
- serena is unavailable in the current runtime and the task requires symbol-aware operations
- the selected routing surface cannot answer after one reasonable attempt
- semantic index status is not ready, or required runtime tooling cannot read the host-local project path
- the task is trivially faster with direct file access

If the agent does not use the matching routing surface on a qualifying task, it MUST state \`Tool routing exception: <reason>\` in the final response or handoff.

## 6) Parallel Agent Orchestration (V8.4)

### Pattern: Plan-First, Batch-Second, Commit-Only

1. **Create plan** (file for large/cross-repo, Beads notes for small)
2. **Batch by outcome** (1 agent per repo or coherent change set)
3. **Execute in waves** (parallel where dependencies allow)
4. **Commit-only** (agents commit, orchestrator pushes once per batch)

### Task Batching Rules

| Files | Approach | Plan Required |
|-------|----------|---------------|
| 1-2, same purpose | Single agent | Mini-plan in Beads |
| 3-5, coherent change | Single agent | Plan file recommended |
| 6+ OR cross-repo | Batched agents | Full plan file required |

### Dispatch Method

**Canonical: dx-runner (governed multi-provider runner)**

\`\`\`bash
# OpenCode throughput lane
dx-runner start --provider opencode --beads bd-xxx --prompt-file /tmp/p.prompt

# Shared monitoring/reporting
dx-runner status --json
dx-runner check --beads bd-xxx --json
\`\`\`

**Canonical batch orchestrator: dx-batch (orchestration-only over dx-runner)**

\`\`\`bash
# Execute implement -> review waves with deterministic ledger/contracts
dx-batch start --items bd-aaa,bd-bbb --max-parallel 2

# Diagnose stuck waves
dx-batch doctor --wave-id <wave-id> --json
\`\`\`

**Direct OpenCode lane (advanced, non-governed)**

\`\`\`bash
# Headless single-run lane
opencode run -m zhipuai-coding-plan/glm-5 "Implement task T1 from plan.md"

# Legacy server lane for parallel clients (opt-in only)
opencode serve --hostname 127.0.0.1 --port 4096
opencode run --attach http://127.0.0.1:4096 -m zhipuai-coding-plan/glm-5 "Implement task T2 from plan.md"
\`\`\`

**Reliability backstop: cc-glm via dx-runner**

\`\`\`bash
# Start governed fallback job
dx-runner start --provider cc-glm --beads bd-xxx --prompt-file /tmp/p.prompt

# Monitor fallback jobs
dx-runner status --json
dx-runner check --beads bd-xxx --json
\`\`\`

**Optional: Task tool (Codex runtime only)**

\`\`\`yaml
Task:
  description: "T1: [batch name]"
  prompt: |
    You are implementing task T1 from plan.md.
    ## Context
    - Dependencies: [T1 has none / T2, T3 complete]
    ## Your Task
    - repo: [repo-name]
    - location: [file1, file2, ...]
    ## Instructions
    1. Read all files first
    2. Implement changes
    3. Commit (don't push)
    4. Return summary
  run_in_background: true
\`\`\`

**Cross-VM: dx-dispatch** (compat wrapper to \`dx-runner\` for remote execution)

### dx-runner Best Practices

- Run \`dx-runner preflight --provider <provider>\` before starting a wave.
- Always pass a unique Beads id per run: \`--beads bd-...\`.
- Use \`--prompt-file\` with immutable prompt artifacts, not inline ad hoc prompts.
- Monitor with \`status --json\` + \`check --json\`; automate on \`reason_code\`/\`next_action\`.
- Use \`report --format json\` as the source of truth for outcome and metrics.
- Prefer one controlled restart max; then escalate using failure taxonomy.
- Run \`dx-runner prune\` periodically to clear stale PID ghosts.
- For OpenCode, enforce canonical model \`zhipuai-coding-plan/glm-5\`; fallback provider if unavailable.

### Monitoring (Simplified)

- **Check interval**: 5 minutes
- **Signals**: 1) Process alive, 2) Log advancing
- **Restart policy**: 1 restart max, then escalate
- **Check**: \`ps -p [PID]\` and \`tail -20 [log]\`

### Anti-Patterns

- One agent per file (overhead explosion)
- No plan file for cross-repo work (coordination chaos)
- Push before review (PR explosion)
- Multiple restarts (brittle)

### Fast Path for Small Work

For 1-2 file changes, use Beads notes instead of plan file:

\`\`\`markdown
## bd-xxx: Task Name
### Approach
- File: path/to/file
- Change: [what]
- Validation: [how]
### Acceptance
- [ ] File modified
- [ ] Validation passed
- [ ] PR merged
\`\`\`

References:
- \`~/agent-skills/docs/ENV_SOURCES_CONTRACT.md\`
- \`~/agent-skills/docs/SECRET_MANAGEMENT.md\`
- \`~/agent-skills/scripts/benchmarks/opencode_cc_glm/README.md\`
- \`~/agent-skills/extended/dx-runner/SKILL.md\`
- \`~/agent-skills/extended/cc-glm/SKILL.md\`

Notes:
 - PR metadata enforcement exists to keep squash merges ergonomic.
 - If unsure what to use for Agent, use platform id (see \`DX_AGENT_ID.md\`).

## 7) Frontend Evidence Contract (Required for UI/UX Claims)

When changing frontend files in \`~/prime-radiant-ai\`, agents MUST follow this workflow:

### Pre-PR Workflow
\`\`\`bash
# 1. Build and verify
pnpm --filter frontend build
pnpm --filter frontend type-check
pnpm --filter frontend lint:css

# 2. Run visual regression (start preview first)
pnpm --filter frontend preview --port 5173 &
VISUAL_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5173 pnpm --filter frontend test:visual

# 3. If baselines need update, justify and commit
VISUAL_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5173 pnpm --filter frontend test:visual:update
\`\`\`

### Route Matrix Verification
- **no-cookie mode**: \`/\`, \`/sign-in\`, \`/sign-up\`
- **bypass-cookie mode**: \`/v2\`, \`/brokerage\` (if auth bypass available)

### Runtime Health Requirements
- No "Unexpected Application Error" on page
- No console errors containing: \`clerk\`, \`ClerkProvider\`, \`Unhandled\`, \`TypeError\`
- Clean page render for all tested routes

### CI Workflows (Auto-triggered)
- \`.github/workflows/visual-quality.yml\` - Stylelint + Visual Regression
- \`.github/workflows/lighthouse.yml\` - Performance budgets

### Required PR Body Section
\`\`\`markdown
## Frontend Evidence

### Route Matrix
| Route | Desktop | Mobile | Status |
|-------|---------|--------|--------|
| / | ✅ | ✅ | Pass |

### Runtime Health
- Console errors: 0
- Unexpected Application Error: No

### Evidence
- Commit SHA: [hash]
- Visual tests: [X] passed
\`\`\`

**Full Template:** \`~/agent-skills/templates/frontend-evidence-contract.md\`

### Pass/Fail Criteria
- ✅ Visual tests pass (or baselines updated with justification)
- ✅ CI checks green (Stylelint, Visual Regression, Lighthouse)
- ❌ Missing evidence section blocks PR
- ❌ Evidence contradicts claims blocks PR

## Core Workflows

| Skill | Description | Example | Tags |
|-------|-------------|---------|------|
| **beads-workflow** | Beads issue tracking and workflow management with automatic git branch creation. MUST BE USED for Beads operations. Handles full epic→branch→work lifecycle, dependencies, and ready task queries. Uses Dolt server mode with runtime at ~/.beads-runtime/.beads for canonical multi-VM reliability. Use when creating epics/features (auto-creates branch), tracking work, finding ready issues, or managing dependencies, or when user mentions "create issue", "track work", "bd create", "find ready tasks", issue management, dependencies, work tracking, or Beads workflow operations. | `bd create --title "Impl: OAuth" --type feature --dep "bd-res` | workflow, beads, issue-tracking, git |
| **create-pull-request** | Create GitHub pull request with atomic Beads issue closure. MUST BE USED for opening PRs. Asks if work is complete - if YES, closes Beads issue BEFORE creating PR. If NO, creates draft PR with issue still open. Automatically links Beads tracking and includes Feature-Key. Use when user wants to open a PR, submit work for review, merge into master, or prepare for deployment, or when user mentions "ready for review", "create PR", "open PR", "merge conflicts", "CI checks needed", "branch ahead of master", PR creation, opening pull requests, deployment preparation, or submitting for team review. | `bd create --title <FEATURE_KEY> --type feature --priority 2 ` | workflow, github, pr, beads, review |

## Repo-Specific Addendum

## llm-common — Repo-Specific Context

### Repo-Memory Brownfield Maps

Before changing provider clients, agent primitives, retrieval, embeddings,
schemas, provenance, or shared verification helpers, read the maintained
repo-memory maps:

- `docs/architecture/README.md`
- `docs/architecture/BROWNFIELD_MAP.md`
- `docs/architecture/DATA_AND_STORAGE.md`
- `docs/architecture/WORKFLOWS_AND_PATTERNS.md`

These maps are the repo-owned source of truth for brownfield orientation.
Beads memory is a pointer/decision log, not proof.

### Shared Library Boundary

`llm-common` owns reusable contracts and primitives. Product-specific business
logic belongs in downstream repos unless there is an explicit promotion
decision.

### Tool Routing

For work in this repo:
- read repo-memory maps first for brownfield orientation when touching mapped areas
- use `serena` first for known-symbol refactors and insertions

If one of these is skipped on a qualifying task, the final response or handoff
must include `Tool routing exception: <reason>`.
